# Cakesheet
These are cheatsheets I created for my Statistics exams. The first half of the course (cheatsheet.pdf) focused on linear regression models and the second half of the course (cheatsheet2.pdf) focused on spatial statistics. 

For easy readability under exam time constrain, I decided to 
heavily abbreviate the terms and colour-code and the sheet using the palette (which I call cake-themed myself, thus created  the illustration below) inspired by the posts from @LVaudor on Twitter. 

### Cakepalette:

The exam was successful, however, I have much more to improve as this is a rough attempt of gathering knowledge from the course - 
possibly more fun than useful. Critiques are appreciated.

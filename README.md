# Cakesheet
This is a cheatsheet I created for my Statistics midterm. For easy readability under exam time constrain, I decided to 
heavily abbreviate the terms and colour code and the sheet using the palette (which I call cake-themed myself, thus created  the illustration below) inspired by the posts from @LVaudor on Twitter. 

### Cakepalette:

The exam was successful, however, I have much more to improve as this is a rough attempt of gathering knowledge from the course - 
possibly more fun than useful. Critiques are appreciated.
